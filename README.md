# UNP-Project-BI-EIRH-MSEXCEL_ADVENTURE_WORKS

AdventureWorks is a widely-used sample database that simulates a fictional bicycle and accessory manufacturing company. In this comprehensive data analysis project, I will dive deep into the AdventureWorks database using SQL to extract valuable insights, answer business-related questions, and present my findings.

The AdventureWorks databases are sample databases that were originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server database using SQL Server 2008. AdventureWorks is the OLTP sample, and AdventureWorksDW is the data warehouse sample. Database design has progressed since AdventureWorks was first published.
